-----Getting Started----
To configure the Movie App for building and testing, follow these steps:

Obtain API Key: The API key required for accessing The Movie Database (TMDb) is provided separately.
Please contact the app developer to obtain the API key.

API Key Configuration: Once you have obtained the API key, you need to add it to the app's source code. 
The API key should be added to a file that is not present in the GitHub repository, since it contains sensitive information = the API key. 
So this file you need to create on your own-->
Create a constants folder and inside it place a file called index.js.
project_root/
│
├── constants/
│   └── index.js
│
Now inside index.js file :
export const apiKey ='IN_HERE_ADD_THE_API_KEY_OBTAINED_FROM_DEVELOPER';
